This is a small project using angularjs to show results from 'The Movie Database' website.
It uses the Movie database api to make requests via angular and uses some angular principles to control and show the data.
to use this there is one step that will ned to be done.
  -go to https://www.themoviedb.org/ and sign up to request an API key.
  -once you have your key this will need to be entered into the 'js/services/movieService.js' file, there is a variable to place your key
